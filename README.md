# CPT_S 415 Project: Collaborative Filtering

Group 1: Joe Patten, Md Muhtasim Billah, Scott Walters, and Md Mahedi Hasan 

We only included the following files. The rest of the files (only with data) can be found in our ec2 instance

- download_data.ipynb

    Notebook used to download data onto ec2 instance
    
- Sequential_user_pearson.ipynb

    User-based collaborative filtering. Similarity is computed using pearson coefficient
    
- Front-end CollabFilter_Distributed (ALS).ipynb

    Model-based collaborative filtering using alternating least squares. This is the notebook we used in our demo
    
- CollabFilter_Distributed (ALS) EXPERIMENT Copy.ipynb

    Model-based collaborative filtering using alternating least squares. This notebook was used to tune hyperparamters
    
- CollabFilter_Sequential (UserBased, SVD, ALS).ipynb

    Sequential collaborative filtering algorithms (using KNN, SVD, and ALS)
