# CPT_S 415 Project: Collaborative Filtering

Group 1: Joe Patten, Md Muhtasim Billah, Scott Walters, and Md Mahedi Hasan 

We only included the following files. The rest of the files (only with data) can be found in our ec2 instance

- <ins>download_data.ipynb</ins>

    Notebook used to download data onto ec2 instance
    
- <ins>Sequential_user_pearson.ipynb</ins>

    User-based collaborative filtering. Similarity is computed using pearson coefficient
    
- <ins>Front-end CollabFilter_Distributed (ALS).ipynb</ins>

    Model-based collaborative filtering using alternating least squares. This is the notebook we used in our demo
    
- <ins>CollabFilter_Distributed (ALS) EXPERIMENT Copy.ipynb</ins>

    Model-based collaborative filtering using alternating least squares. This notebook was used to tune hyperparamters
    
- <ins>CollabFilter_Sequential (UserBased, SVD, ALS).ipynb</ins>

    Sequential collaborative filtering algorithms (using KNN, SVD, and ALS)
